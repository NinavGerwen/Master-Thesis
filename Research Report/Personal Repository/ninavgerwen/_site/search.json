    "text": "A Budding Statistician\n\nAbout me\nI am currently a graduate student at the Master’s programme of Methodology and Statistics at Utrecht University, finalizing my thesis under the guidance of Dr. Dave Hessen in the field of Item Response Theory. I’m incredibly passionate about education, which is why for my programme I joined the Programme Advisory Committee and Educational Commitee. My aims are to further develop myself in the field of Statistics by entering the academic world and to start teaching in the field. Therefore, I am fervently searching for a PhD position in the field starting September 2023.\nFor more detailed information about my background and education, feel free to check out my LinkedIn and/or CV.\n\n\nExperience in the field\nAlthough I currently have no published research (which will hopefully change once my MSc is finished in two months), my statistical experiences include: (a) a confirmatory and exploratory meta-analysis of the effect of institutions in Social Dilemmas, (b) programming my own Gibbs and Metropolis-Hastings sampler, (c) programming several simulation studies investigating new the performance of fit indices and goodness-of-fit tests, (d) performing, interpreting and evaluating different types of multilevel models and much more! For an overview of some of my programming, check out my GitHub.\nTo contact me, you can email me at: n.l.vangerwen@uu.nl. [^index-1] [^index-1]: This site was made using Quarto."
