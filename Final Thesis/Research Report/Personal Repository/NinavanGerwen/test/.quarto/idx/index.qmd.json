Although interested in all of Statistics, I am most enthusiastic about the more theoretical and mathematical side of the field. In addition, I'm incredibly passionate about the education and its quality, which is why I joined the Programme Advisory Committee and Educational Commitee to try and improve the quality of the programme. Besides that, I believe that all Science should be Open Science in order to better develop the reliability and\ntrustworthiness of Science as a whole. \n\nMy aims for the near future correspond to these values, and that is why I wish to further develop myself in the field of Statistics by entering the academic world and to personally start teaching in the field. Therefore, I am fervently searching for a fitting PhD position in the field starting September 2023.\n\nFor more detailed information about my background and education, feel free to check out my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nina-van-gerwen-946aa31b4/) and/or CV.\n\n### Experience in the field\n\nAlthough I currently have no published research (subject to change once my MSc thesis is finished in a few months), my statistical experiences include: (a) a confirmatory and exploratory meta-analysis of the effect of institutions in Social Dilemmas, (b) programming my own Gibbs and Metropolis-Hastings sampler, (c) programming several simulation studies investigating new the performance of fit indices and goodness-of-fit tests, (d) coding, interpreting and evaluating different types of multilevel models, and much more!
