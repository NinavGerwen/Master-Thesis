# RESEARCH ARCHIVE

---

This project contains two folders. The first folder, **Supplementary Materials**, contains all necessary files to either replicate or completely reproduce 
the simulation study for the Master thesis "Assessing Fit of Item Theory Response Models using a Multiple Group Likelihood Ratio Test and Fit Indices" 
by Nina van Gerwen under supervision of Dr. Dave Hessen. Software requirements for this are R (https://www.r-project.org/) and multiple R packages. All code
is annotated. The second folder, **Manuscript files**, contains the files necessary to knit the manuscript for my Master thesis and an already knitted version.
Below you find a table that gives more detailed information on all included files per folder.

## Supplementary Materials

| Files/Folders 		| Description	|
| ----------------------------- | ------------- |
|Empirical-Example.rmd 		|Rmarkdown file to run the analyses performed in the empirical example|
|Empirical-Example.html		|Knitted version of the 'Empirical-Example.rmd' file that also contains session information under which the analyses were run|
|Functions			|Folder that contains annotated functions used in the different simulation studies and empirical example|
|Simulation-Study-I-FI.rmd	|Rmarkdown file that contains the simulation which assessed the performance of the Tucker Lewis Index, Identity Coefficient Fit Index and Comparative Fit Index to detect model missspecification|
|Simulation-Study-I-FI.html	|Knitted version of the 'Simulation-Study-I-FI.rmd' file that also contains session information under which the simulation was run|
|Simulation-Study-I-GoF.rmd	|Rmarkdown file that contains the simulation which assessed the performance of the Multiple Group Likelihood Ratio, Chi-square difference and Pearson's chi-square test to detect model missspecification|
|Simulation-Study-I-GoF.html	|Knitted version of the 'Simulation-Study-I-GoF.rmd' file, which also contains session information under which the simulation was run|
|Simulation-Study-II.rmd	|Rmarkdown file that contains the simulation which assessed the performance of the Multiple Group Likelihood Ratio test to discern group differences|
|Simulation-Study-II.html	|Knitted version of the 'Simulation-Study-II.html' file that also contains session information under which the simulation was run|

The results found in the .html files were used in the end product of the manuscript.

## Manuscript Files

| Files/Folders 	| Description	|
| --------------------- | ------------- |
|Manuscript.tex		|Tex file that when knitted in LaTeX replicates the manuscript for my Master thesis|
|Manuscript.pdf		|Knitted version of 'Manuscript.tex'|
|reportref.bib		|Bibliography file that contains information for the references used in 'Manuscript.tex'|
|sagej.cls		|A class file that is necessary to create a LaTeX file according to SAGE standards for the Journal of Applied Psychological Measurement|
