## This function generates dichotomous IRT data of sample size n
## with test length k, according to three IRT models (1PL, 2Pl, 3PL)

## Note that to use this function, you need to source also the
## functions listed in the model-calculations.R file

## the length of the test and according to which model you want to
## generate data

  ## from a standard normal distribution

  ## Then, create a matrix of betas (difficulty parameters) by

  ## here, the beta values chosen are -1, -0.5, 0, etc.

  ## properly calculate the probabilities for every person given every item
